# Local output paths
# Note: When running as a packaged executable, relative paths will be resolved differently:
# - Development mode: Uses paths relative to current directory
# - Packaged executable: Uses ~/.domo-cli/logs/ for logs (ignores LOG_PATH)
# You can override with absolute paths if needed (e.g., LOG_PATH=/tmp/domo-logs)
